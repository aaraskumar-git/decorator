A function is called with 2 parameters for division.
The function which does the division is decorated by a decorator.
The decorator takes the two parameters and check whether the denomenator is zero or not.
If it is zero, prints the msg that division cannot be performed with zero as denomenator.
Else, it goes aheads with returning to the function to perform the division.
